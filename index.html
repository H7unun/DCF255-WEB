  <<h1><strong><<b>INTRODUCTION</b></strong></h1>
    <p>&nbsp;Cyber security is the art of protecting networks, devices and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality,&nbsp;integrity,&nbsp;and availability of&nbsp;information.&nbsp;The&nbsp;main goal of this study is to inform your personnel about the harmful security flaws so that future attacks won&apos;t be possible. This report will also give you the best security precautions to take&nbsp;to&nbsp;prevent future cybercrime against your business.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>The mission-critical assets you are trying to secure should be the focal point of the seven cybersecurity levels.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>&quot;Companies have a tendency to value everything as imperative just in case if they don&apos;t know what data they have or how to organise it. The secret to success when selecting how to protect your data and apps is to determine what is mission-critical, or what your firm cannot function without.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
</div>

            <li>
                <p><strong><<b>Mission Critical Assets</b></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; This is the data you need to protect.&nbsp;Devices, programmes, and databases are mission-critical assets because they form the backbone of your company. The business could not function without them. Therefore, it makes logical that your security plan is composed of several levels, each of which serves a different purpose in defending your mission-critical assets.&nbsp;In this, the business works with about 80 body shops and accepts orders through a small, hosted website. Additionally, the business was the target of a ransomware attack that encrypted all their backend databases. Therefore, we must use security measures to protect the website.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong><<b>Data Security</b></strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Every organization depends on its data to function. It helps with decision-making, problem-solving, increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, enhancing customer service, informing marketing initiatives, lowering risks, boosting productivity, fostering teamwork, and ultimately contributing to rising revenue and profit.&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Data is frequently described as a company&apos;s &quot;crown jewels,&quot; and as such, it requires considerable consideration to ensure its security.&nbsp;Data security is achieved when security measures are used to safeguard both the transfer and storage of data. To prevent data loss, a backup security solution must be in place. This calls for the usage of encryption and archiving.&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>All firms place a high priority on data security since a data breach could have disastrous effects.&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <div>
        <p>An organisation must first be aware of the data it has before it can secure it. A data inventory, which is a list of all the data an organisation has created, consumed, and stored, is essential in this situation. Data discovery, or finding out what and where the data is, is the first step in the process. The process of classifying data entails giving it names so that it will be simpler to handle, store, and secure. The following are the four standard data classification categories:&nbsp;public information,&nbsp;confidential information,&nbsp;sensitive&nbsp;information&nbsp;and&nbsp;personal information.&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>There are different types of data security technologies such as firewalls, Authentication/authorization, Encryption, Data masking, Hardware &ndash; based security, data backup and resilience.&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>We take care of the organization&apos;s data security after the mission-critical assets. By using this approach, we safeguard the privacy, accuracy, and accessibility of an organization&apos;s data. Data must be accessible to authorised individuals, maintained in confidence, and have integrity to guarantee accuracy and dependability.&nbsp;</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p><strong><<b>Application layer:</b></strong>&nbsp;Application security seeks to defend data and software application code from online dangers. Application security may and should be used throughout the whole development process, including design, development, and deployment.&nbsp;In order to&nbsp;increase application security across the software development lifecycle (SDLC), consider the following strategies:&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Introduce security tools and standards while designing and developing applications. Consider including vulnerability screening in the early stages of development.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Put security policies and methods in place to safeguard apps in production settings. For instance, carry out ongoing security testing.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>For applications that require mission-critical access or contain sensitive data, use strong authentication.&nbsp;Use security tools like intrusion detection systems, web application firewalls, and firewalls (IPS).&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Software that is available over the Internet and is hosted on a web server is referred to as a web application. In a web browser, the client is used. Applications are compelled to accept connections from users over insecure networks by nature. They become vulnerable to&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;threats as a result. A primary priority for any cyber security programme is to protect online apps, which are frequently business-critical and contain sensitive customer data, making them an attractive target for attackers.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>The advent of HTTPS, which establishes an encrypted communication channel and defends against man in the middle (MitM) attacks, is one example of how the Internet&apos;s evolution has addressed web application weaknesses.&nbsp;We perform the application security following the data security. And the WAF will be used for this. HTTP traffic that travels between a web application and the Internet is watched over and filtered by a WAF. While WAF technology cannot protect against every danger,&nbsp;it can be used in conjunction with a variety of security solutions to provide a comprehensive protection against several attack vectors.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Web applications are protected by WAF, which acts as a protocol layer seven defence in the open systems interconnection (OSI) paradigm, from threats such cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site forgery, SQL injection, and file inclusion.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>A WAF functions like a reverse proxy to protect the server from exposure, in contrast to a proxy server, which hides the identities of client machines through an intermediary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>RASP can be added to our website as well. Runtime application traffic and user behaviour analysis is possible with RASP technology. Through gaining visibility into application source code and examining vulnerabilities and weaknesses, it seeks to assist in the detection and prevention of cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>To offer proactive security, RASP technologies can spot security flaws that have already been exploited, stop these sessions, and send out alerts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <li>
                <p><strong><<b>End point layers:</b></strong>&nbsp;The cybersecurity strategy for protecting endpoints, such as desktops, laptops, and mobile devices, against malicious activities is known as endpoint security, or endpoint protection.&nbsp;Any device that connects to the business network from outside its firewall is considered an endpoint. Because every remote endpoint might serve as an attack&apos;s point of entry and because of the massive shift to remote work that the pandemic has caused, endpoints are becoming increasingly important. A Gallup survey found that 51% of US employees were still working remotely in April 2021, up from a majority in 2020. Endpoint hazards and the sensitive data they contain are an ongoing problem.&nbsp;Businesses of all sizes are prime candidates for cyberattacks because to the endpoint landscape&apos;s continual change.&nbsp;Endpoint security refers to the centralised security management tools that businesses use to safeguard their endpoints, such as servers, workstations, mobile devices, and workloads, from online threats. Endpoint protection programmes search for indicators of suspicious or malicious activities in files, processes, and system activity. Endpoint protection programmes provide a centralised management interface through which administrators may access their company&apos;s network for the purposes of monitoring, securing, looking into, and responding to problems. By using an on-premises, hybrid, or cloud strategy, this is achieved.&nbsp;We will employ the&nbsp;on-premises&nbsp;security posture in this layer. Since the management console communicates with the endpoints via an agent to provide security, the data centre serves as the hub for this process.&nbsp;Due to the fact that&nbsp;administrators often can only manage endpoints inside their perimeter, the hub and spoke approach might result in security silos&nbsp;</p>

            <li>
                <p>&nbsp;<strong><<b>Network Layer:</b></strong>&nbsp;A lot of shared networks, like the Internet, have seen a rise in&nbsp;the adoption of network layer security controls for communication security&nbsp;since they can protect several applications simultaneously without altering them.&nbsp;Network security measures guard a company&apos;s network and stop unauthorised access to it.&nbsp;The popular framework developed for ensuring security at network layer is Internet Protocol Security (IPsec).&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><strong><<b>Features of IPsec:</b></strong>&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The IPsec protocol was not created to be exclusively compatible with TCP. Any protocol above IP, such as ICMP, OSPF, and UDP, can be used with it.&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The whole packet provided to the IP layer, including headers from higher layers, is protected by IPsec&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It is more difficult to analyse communications because higher layer headers that carry port numbers are concealed.&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>IPsec only functions from one network entity to another, not from one application process to another. Security can be implemented as a result without requiring modifications to individual user computers or applications.&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>IPsec is most frequently used to create Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), either between two sites (gateway-to-gateway) or between a remote user and a business network (host-to-gateway).&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

</div>
<div>
    <div>
        <p>A collection of protocols called IPsec is used to secure network A collection&nbsp;of&nbsp;protocols called IPsec is used to secure network communications. It is a somewhat complicated mechanism because, rather than providing a clear definition of a particular encryption algorithm and authentication function, it offers a framework that permits the implementation of any encryption or authentication method that both communicating ends can agree upon.&nbsp;The two basic communication protocols employed by IPsec are Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). ESP can authenticate and encrypt the data passed over the connection, whereas AH can just authenticate.&nbsp;Between two endpoints, Transport Mode offers a secure connection without modifying the IP header. The whole IP payload packet is encapsulated in tunnel mode. A fresh IP header is added. Due to its ability to create a secure virtual tunnel through an insecure Internet, the latter is utilised to create a typical VPN.&nbsp;The secret values used for encryption or hashing must be known by both communication endpoints. Manual keys call for the manual entering of the secret values on both sides, presumably transmitted by some out-of-band technique, and IKE (Internet Key Exchange) is a sophisticated system for carrying out this online.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Through this layer we will try to provide confidentiality to the company by enabling the communication nodes to encrypt messages which will prevent eavesdropping by the third parties using VPN.&nbsp;By encrypting traffic before it enters the public Internet and logically separating it from other traffic, VPN technology allows an institution&apos;s inter-office traffic to be sent over the public Internet.&nbsp;In addition to this security at network layer will also provide origin authentication and data integrity.&nbsp;It will guarantee that a packet received was genuinely communicated by the party acknowledged as the source in the packet header and will verify that the packet has not been tampered with in any way.&nbsp;It will also provide protection against the security attacks such as replay attacks.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;Perimeter Layer:&nbsp;An additional layer of security between your assets and&nbsp;the&nbsp;internet is offered by a perimeter network, which might be a physical or logical&nbsp;network&nbsp;segment. Only intended traffic can enter your virtual network thanks to specialised network access control devices at the perimeter of a perimeter network.&nbsp;The advantage of perimeter networks is that you can concentrate your network access control management, monitoring, logging, and reporting on the equipment at the edge of your Azure virtual network. It is customary to implement distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation, intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS), firewall rules and policies, web filtering, network antimalware, and other security measures on a perimeter network. Between your Azure virtual network and the internet, there is a point of contact for the network security devices.&nbsp;Depending on the location, this layer may also comprise security guards, fencing, security feeds, intrusion detection equipment, and other security measures.&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>We have control over our network, technology, and data up to the perimeter. It is the edge of what we can influence and have a duty to protect. As a result, it serves as the initial line of defence against numerous outside threats to the network.&nbsp;Our network perimeter can be defined and secured in&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;ways. The precise methods for defending a network, however, are outside the purview of this essay because every network is unique. At the risk of oversimplifying, the steps and resources listed below will give a better idea of how to protect the network edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Identify the perimeter &ndash; document all devices that have access to your network&nbsp;</p>
            </li>

        <p>7) &nbsp;<strong><<b>Human Layer:</b></strong>&nbsp;By recognising human communication patterns and behaviour, creating a distinctive security identity for every employee, and gradually enhancing their security reflexes, Human Layer Security (HLS) automatically recognises and prevents threats.&nbsp;More digital data than ever before is being produced, gathered, stored, and transferred by today&apos;s organizations. And&nbsp;during&nbsp;the data&apos;s existence, people engage with it frequently. We&apos;re not just referring to data stored in databases in organised formats&mdash;if a worker just creates an email containing a client&apos;s or service user&apos;s personal information, that email&mdash;in its unstructured format&mdash;becomes sensitive data and must be protected with the necessary security measures. Increase this by all the sensitive data documents that employees may create or&nbsp;access, and add email to the list of possible access points for this data (collaboration platforms, file-transfer services, even SMS), often from different locations as employees work in the office or online or remotely or even on the move using mobile&nbsp;devices&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Conclusion-&nbsp;Understanding cybersecurity is a challenging topic that calls for knowledge and expertise from many fields, including but not limited to computer science and information technology, psychology, economics, organisational behaviour, political science, engineering, sociology, decision sciences, international relations, and law. It is simple for policy analysts and others to become bogged down in the technical specifics,&nbsp;but technological&nbsp;measures are only one critical component of cybersecurity. Additionally, knowledge about cybersecurity is frequently divided into disciplinary categories, which limits the insights that may be gained from cross-fertilization.&nbsp;This primer seeks to illuminate some of these connections. Most of all, it attempts to leave the reader with two central ideas. The cybersecurity problem will never be solved once and for all. Solutions to the problem, limited in scope and longevity though they may be, are at least as much nontechnical as technical in nature.&nbsp;</p>
